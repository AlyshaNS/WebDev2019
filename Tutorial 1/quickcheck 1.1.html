            1. A way of describing the content and structure of a document by "tagging" elements
            to organize how they differfrom each other. For instance a paragraph is different than a header.
            2. XHTML = Extensible Hypertext Markup Language.
            XHTML was built to improve upon an existing form of HTML, and to conform HTML to XML standards.
            From what I uderstand, XHTML was more strict and far less forgiving than HTML in comparison. It's v 2.0 
            was discontinued in 2009, and HTML5 is now standard. 
            3. W3C = Word Wide Web Consortioum (XHTML creators)
               WHATWG = Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (Developped to create 
               a rival to the currently (at the time) in developpment XHTML 2.0)
            4. A processing instruction indicating the markup language the used in the document. 
            <!--<!DOCTYPE html>--> 
            5. The way the elemnt tags are placed is wrong. Since the strong element tag begins after the paragraph
            tag, it should end before. 
            <!--<p><strong> Curbside Thai now delivers!</strong></p>-->
            6. <!--<title> Curbside Thai Employment Opportunities</title>-->
            7. <!--<meta name = "Keywords" content = "Food truck, North Carolina, dining"/>-->
