        <p>2.The aside element (&lt;aside&gt;)</p>
        <p>3.div is something found in older HTML code. It is used to mark sections on web page
            such as header and sections. (ex. &lt;div id=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;) It was 
            "scrapped" for lack of a better word in HTML5 because the div element has no "no rules for the
            id's. One web developper might identify the page heading with the id <i>header</i>
            while anohter designer might use <i>heading</i>." <cite>The textbook</cite>. This was changed
            to allow for consistency and ease of reading between developpers. Now everyone uses the same
            id's for page sectioning. Though the old way is still available to use.
