	Inline Style = applied directly to an elemnt through the use of the style attribute
in the elemnts tag. Meaning they apply to that element alone. 
	Ebedded Style = Added to the head of an HTML doc, only apply to the doc in which they are 
created, and are not accessible to docs in the website. Embedded AND Inline are not considered good practice
because HTML should only describe the content and structure, not the style. 
	External Sytle = A CSS file. It describes how a website should look and is linked to in the HTML file. This way the
HTML file described the contents and structure of the site and the CSS file describes the site's style. 

External styles are the best for designing an entire website.
