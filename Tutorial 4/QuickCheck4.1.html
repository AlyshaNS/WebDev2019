    <p>1. Provide code to create a figure box containing the logo.png image file, no alt
    text, and a caption with the text Tree and Book.<p>
        

    <p>2. What is the difference between a vector image and a bitmap image?</br>
        A vector image is an image in which the lines and curves that comprise the image are based on mathematical functions.</br>
        Bitmap is when each bit is assigned a color.</p> 

    <p>3. Provide the code to use the sidebar.png file as the background image for the</br>
    page body. Have the image placed in the top-left corner of the page and tiled</br>
    only in the horizontal direction.</br>
        body {background: url (sidebar.png) left top repeat-x;}</p>

    <p>4. Create a style rule for the header element that fills the header background</br>
    with tiled images of the back.png, but only over the element content.</br>
        header {background-image: url(back.png); background-repeat: repeat; background-clip: content-box; }</p>

    5. Provide a style rule to display the logo.png and side.png image files in the top-left
    corner of the page bodyâ€™s background. Do not tile the logo.png image, but tile the
    side.png image vertically. Design your style rule so that logo.png appears on top
    of the side.png. For the rest of the page body, set the background color to ivory.

    <p>6. Provide a style rule to add a 5-pixel dotted brown border around the aside</br>
    element.</br>
        aside {border: 5px dotted brown;}</p>

    7. Provide a style rule to add a 3-pixel solid blue border around the header
    element with rounded corners of 15 pixels.

    8. Provide a style rule to add elongated corners with a 5-pixel gray inset border
    around the aside element and with a horizontal radius of 10 pixels and vertical
    radius of 5 pixels.

    9. Provide a style rule to use the graphic image file border.png as a solid border
    for the article element. Set the size of the image slice to 30 pixels and stretch
    the sides to match the sides of the element. Assume a border width of 10 pixels
